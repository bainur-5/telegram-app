# Deliverable

Static client-ready markup extracted from React + TS + SCSS source.

## Structure
- `pages/` – 5 screens
- `scss/` – partial-based SCSS architecture + `main.scss` imports
- `js/` – minimal UI interactions only (modal/dropdown/tabs/toggles)
- `reports/` – audit, mapping, coverage, visual lock docs
